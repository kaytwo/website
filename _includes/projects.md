[Cloudsweeper](https://cloudsweeper.cs.uic.edu/) allows users to audit, encrypt, and redact sensitive information within cloud storage accounts. This project helps us better understand the role of cleartext password emailing, the underground value of stolen accounts, and new ways to improve the security of sensitive, globally accessible information.

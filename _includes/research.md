I conduct data-driven research on the socio-technical aspects of
cybersecurity. This research includes characterizing the shifting long-term
privacy needs of Internet users, better understanding the extent to which deep
learning threatens user security and privacy on the web, as well as the
practical impact of security-centric tools like Single Sign-On and VPNs for
users and non-users alike.

I am very interested in new collaborations, motivated students, and lively
conversation regarding security research - please reach out via email or
twitter if you'd like to chat!

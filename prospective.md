title: Prospective students

As mentioned on my home page, I am *always* interested in new collaborations
and motivated students! Unfortunately, I don't have time to answer most unsolicited emails from students. If you'd like to work with me, your best bet is to arrive at UIC for the PhD, excel in your classwork, show interest and familiarity with related work, or propose an independent project of your own design.

Any questions regarding admission to the UIC MS or PhD program should be directed to [Student Affairs](https://cs.uic.edu/graduate/admissions/).
